<li>The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.</li>
<li>What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).</li>
<li>In addition, the IP address, user agent string, and initial page inspection analytics.js does when creating a new tracker is used to determine things like the following:</li>
<li>The geographic location of the user.</li>
<li>What browser and operating system are being used.</li>
<li>Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.</li>
<li>The referring site.</li>
</ul>
