<h2>Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk</h2>
<p>We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.</p> 
So, remember to avoid:</br>
<ul>
<li>name-calling</li>
<li>ad hominem attacks</li>
<li>Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.</li>
<li>knee-jerk contradiction.</li>
</ul>
</body>
