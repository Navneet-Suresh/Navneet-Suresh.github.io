# Introduction:



Hey guys, I hope your doing well.

Today I am going to share my plan to use 3 **Raspberry** pi 3 Model B to host a WordPress website and a mail server. I am doing this project to explore the endless possibilities of RasPi ðŸ˜‰.

If you are interested you can read further as I will share my experience and how to do it yourself.

Thanks to people at [/r/raspberry_pi subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/6pvnme/raspberry_pi_to_host_website_and_mail_server/) who guided me.

### Note:


This post will be edited as and when I start this project(pretty soon)

Thank you for taking your time to read it, have a good day.
